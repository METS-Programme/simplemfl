- should facilities inherit from orgunit as separate class?
- API search by any of the external IDs
	- ID alone
	- "agency::context::external_id" triplet
- infrastructure for submissions with approval process
	- existing
	- new
	* store proposed updates as JSON payloads to API calls (POST, PATCH)
	* allow upload of confirming documents?
	* allow comments/notes on update request
		* canned reply text widget?
	* generate human-readable output listing
	* when approved run API call on endpoint
	* allow multiple facility updates in one request?
- API listing for ownerships, authorities, orgunit types?

- Front page?
	- summaries
		* look at print MFL for inspiration
	- coordinate coverage (total, by region, by type)

===========================

- string of coordinates
	- basic support
- GEO-JSON geometry string
	- structured format
	- easily store area (country, district, subcounty) and point geometries
	- usable by Javascript mapping libraries
- PostGIS database support
	- geometry operations (contains, nearest)
	- tiling support reduces bandwidth, increases performance (esp. mobile)
